Geospatialib aims to contribute to the discoverability of and access to all forms geospatial data -- anyone can onboard, visualize and interact with geospatial data as long as it's served over the web; they can create, draw and symbolize vector layers; and they can design, export and share their own maps -- all in the comfort of a web browser.
